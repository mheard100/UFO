# Deliverable 2: 
## A written report on the UFO analysis
### Deliverable Requirements:
For your written analysis, be sure to use complete and coherent sentences. Your written analysis should contain three sections, which cover the following:

1. **Overview of Project:** Explain the purpose of this analysis. 
2. **Results:** Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.
3. **​Summary:** In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.

## Overview
Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results
The final result was the working website that allowed for five different categories to filter the data: date, city, state, country, and shape of the UFO.

To access the webpage you can click here: [Active Github Pages](https://mheard100.github.io/UFOs/)

- The website displays the data in the form of a well structured table with UFO sighting data: date, city, state, country, shape, duration, and additional comments. 
- The website was designed using JavaScript and HTML and arranged/modified with CSS and Bootstrap. 
- To navigate through its functionality, the user would need to click on the input boxes provided to the bottom left and enter a valid text-option for the category to be filtered. If you enter a incorrect fitler or a variable that does not exist in the data, you will get an empty table.  
- To come back to the original dataset (without filters included) click on the top left where it says **UFO Sightings** and the HTML will get redirected. 

Filter example: 
![UFO_Website_ss_specific]![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97119920/159179263-e0310e82-f022-417c-8812-d29cbd7f6553.png)

Multi-filter example: 
![UFO_Website_ss_specific2]![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97119920/159179297-f835da48-c62c-43ba-b151-dbfbc3a26612.png)

## Summary
A major drawback is the data.js itself. There isn't a lot of data involved relatively. Expanding the data to include more sightings and more places across the world would be beneficial to the success of the website. Another recommendation would be to futher decorate the website. CSS and Bootstrap have infinite options to make an even more aesthetically pleasant website. Something more interactive would draw the attention of users.
